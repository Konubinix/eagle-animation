# EagleAnimation

__EagleAnimation__ is an awesome, free and open-source animation software.

## Build

### Production build

- Software will be bundled in the `dist` directory.

### Development mode

- Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
- Run `npm start` to launch the application in dev mode (Hot reloading and toolbar).

## Telemetry

To improve the quality of __Eagle Animation__, runtime errors are automatically reported to developpers by using [Sentry SDK](https://sentry.io/) and user behaviors are analysed by using **Google Analytics** events.
You can disable error reporting and tracking, just set `SENTRY_DSN` and `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS` to `""` in `config.js` and rebuild the app.
